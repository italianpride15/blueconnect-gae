Project's Goal:

To find people near you (both in background and foreground) using BT and find what they have in common with you.

Project currently __not being developed__ anymore because POC HotCold showed that CoreBluetooth is not capable to broadcast anything but UUID in background. Would need something similar to iBeacon but Apple doesn't let you broadcast in the background with that since it is only aimed at advertisers having a deticated iBeacon broadcasting you ads.
